## Issues running powershell
By default windows doesn't allow to run powershell scripts, see [execution policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-6#powershell-execution-policies)

### Permanent allow to run this script
Open Start, search for PowerShell, right-click the top-result and click the Run as administrator option.

Check your execution policy by running the command `Get-ExecutionPolicy`

To change to a policy that allow you to run scripts, run powershell as administrator and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

To unblock this file only, go to the folder you downloaded the file and run `Unblock-File .\goproMergeEncode.ps1`

### Temporary allow
Run from command line `powershell â€“ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

All scripts run during this session will bypass the restrictions.

## Notes
Based on the file name format GOPR2548.MP4 and multiple files GP012548.MP4, GP022548.MP4,... and folder structure ..\GoPro\2019-04-21\HERO5 Black 1\
Note that the stucture works for single videos for the camera models: HD HERO2, HERO3, HERO3+, HERO (2014), HERO Session, HERO4, HERO5 Black, HERO5 Session, HERO (2018)

For HERO6 Black, & HERO7 (White, Silver, Black) or other formats use -mergeAll parameter

This was made quick and dirty as way for me to learn more about powershell, it can be improved/simplified massively.
Decided to make it open source, since others might find usage.
